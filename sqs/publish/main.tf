# sqs — publisher stack
#
# Publishes the service as the package np-aws-sqs, visible to every organization,
# from each release: the specs of the released tag and the worker image the
# same release pushed, pinned by digest. Only the release workflow runs it,
# through actions-nullplatform's publish-package, which passes the three
# variables below as TF_VAR_*. The release contract (version from the tag,
# prerelease handling, guards) lives in tofu-modules' service_package_publish.
